# FFT Implementation Documentation

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Components
1. Basic FFT class structure 
2. Data point generation from function strings
3. Twiddle factor (W) computation for roots of unity
4. Bit reversal lookup table
5. Comprehensive test suite

### Project Structure
- `index.html`: P5.js setup and configuration
- `FFT.js`: Main FFT class implementation
- `sketch.js`: Testing and visualization framework

## Development Roadmap

### Pending Implementation
1. Butterfly computation (Step 3)
2. Coefficient extraction (Step 4)
3. Series evaluation and symbolic representation
4. Result visualization

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Requirements
- Input size (N) must be a power of 2
- Complex numbers represented as `{re, im}` objects
- Twiddle factors (W) precomputed for performance optimization
- Careful attention to sign conventions in complex arithmetic
- Robust handling of edge cases, particularly near Ï€ boundaries

### Testing Strategy

#### Priority Test Cases
1. Power of 2 input validation
2. Twiddle factor computation accuracy
3. Bit reversal algorithm correctness
4. Point generation and spacing verification
5. FFT accuracy validation against known functions
